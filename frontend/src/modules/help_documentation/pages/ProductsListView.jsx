        This section is refering to the list of products seen in the sidebar or
        on the dashboard page. Important thing to note is that if you're a
        producer of the project, you are only seeing the products for which you
        were marked as their producer. But if you're an owner of the project,
        you are seeing the whole list of products in this project.
